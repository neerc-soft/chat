#summary XEP for NEERC specific stuff (task manager, timer, etc)

= Introduction =

We need to make our own external jabber server component (see [http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0114.html Jabber Component Protocol]), to which clients will communicate independently of MUC (chat) service.

Similar to MUC, it has fixed JID (neerc.%hostname%), known by client.

= Use cases =

Clients can send following queries via iq stanzas:
  * Query current task list (including task status for current user or all users)
  * Query current permissions for this service (admin/user)
  * Change task status for a task for sending user
  * Add new task (admin only)
  * Remove task (admin only)
  * Assign task to user/group
  * Subscribe to task list/status updates

Groups and admin list are stored in component configuration.
On any task change, component should notify all subscribed users.
